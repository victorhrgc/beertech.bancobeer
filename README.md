# beertech.bancobeer
Legacy POC for Becks group

# Access credentials
RabbitURL = http://localhost:15672/  
SwaggerUI = http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

Rabbit user: guest  
Rabbit password: guest  

Postgres user: postgres  
Postgres password: password  

# How to test locally
- Java 8 / Maven / Your favourite IDE / Git
- Ports 8080, 8081 and 8082 must be available
- Clone the repo @ https://github.com/victorhrgc/beertech.bancobeer.git
- 'docker-compose up' in the root directory to start the postgres and the rabbit container
- Start the API(8080), the Consumer(8081) and the ExternalBank(8082) applications on your IDE ('BancoBeerApiApplication.java', 'BancoBeerConsumerApplication.java', 'ExternalbankApplication.java')
- Access the API methods with either swagger (everything) or rabbitMQ (transactions)

# How to post a transaction message on RabbitMQ
- Go to 'Exchanges' and click on the exchange named 'transactions.consumer.exchange'
- Go to the 'Publish Message' section and add a ROUTING KEY and PAYLOAD for the desired transaction as follows:
  - deposit.rk    <-> {"accountCode":"", "value":"", "jwtToken":""}
  - withdrawal.rk <-> {"accountCode":"", "value":"", "jwtToken":""}
  - statements.rk <-> {"accountCode":"", "jwtToken":""}
  - transfer.rk   <-> {"originAccountCode":"", "destinationAccountCode":"", "value":"", "jwtToken":""}
  
  
  # Payments

  - How to create a paymentslip on the database  (payment slip)
  
    POST -> http://localhost:8082/payment-slips or https://beertech-bank-externalbank.herokuapp.com/payment-slips if using Heroku
    {"date":"20201024",  "value":"010200", "origin":"001/conta", "destination":"002/11111", "category":"OT"}

    Date:                 yyyyMMdd
    Value:                R$102,00 = 010200 
	  Origin e Destination: Bank/Account in which Bank = 001 or 002(External) and Accounts have 5 digits
    Category:             OT / EN / FO / ED / SE
    
   - To pay a payment slip you need to find the code created on the API database by the above procedure and when you pay it, the external bank will return error on even minutes and success on odd minutes (real life time).
